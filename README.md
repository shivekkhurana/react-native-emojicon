## Inspiration
While building with react native, it was a common routine to pull in the awesome [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) library, but we already have so many pretty icons, inbuilt into the phone.

Emojis are used widely for communication, how about using them to develop UI ?
And this library came into being.


## Installation

```
npm install react-native-emojicon
```

## Usage

```
	...
	import Emojicon from 'react-native-emojicon';
	...

	class Emoji extends Component {
	 
		render() {
			return (
				<Emojicon name={'speedboat'} size={50} />
				<Emojicon name={'alarm-clock'} size={50} />
				<Emojicon name={'alarm_clock'} size={50} />
			);
		}
	}
```

## Emoji Name
The name prop can be a any valid name from the following list :

Spaces are replaced with hyphen `-` or underscore `_`.
So `alarm clock` from the list can be written as both `alarm-clock` and `alarm_clock`
